For this particular instance, counting characters, I would prefer collections.counter. For finding instances of a specific substring, I would use a regular expression or the str.count() method. I haven't tested, but there may be a performance difference due to a slight overhead in counting all characters and appending to a dictionary rather than counting occurrences of a single substring. I would suggest writing a script to generate a very long file to search and then timing execution of each method.
